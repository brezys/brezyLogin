# GUI Login - Client to Server Authentication
I am developing an open-source GUI login forum in Python, equipped with a from scratch server hosting a database file. This system handles login and sign-up queries from the client. It efficiently parses these queries, providing the clients with appropriate responses to guide their actions. The combination of a user-friendly interface and a robust server infrastructure ensures a secure and seamless authentication process.
